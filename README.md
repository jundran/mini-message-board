## Description
TOP - Mini Message Board project

This a simple message board app created to practise what I have learned about Express so far. It serves PUG templates. The index route shows the message board. The user can fill out the form to post a new message to the "/new" route which will save the message to an array. The user is then redirected to the index page which fetches the updated array of messages.Messages are persisted as long as the server remains running and can be seen by all users. For a production ready app, a database would be needed to provide authorization and data persistance when the server goes offline but that is beyond the scope of this project.
